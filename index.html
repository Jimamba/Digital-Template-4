<h2>Interview Memorization</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A platformer mixed with memorization, where some platforms are fakes and will kill the
player.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Frustration, but at the same time I want them to be able to remember what to do.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer/Puzzle.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A player has the option to move left or right with the arrow keys and jump by pressing F.
Unfortunately, they cannot move and jump at the same time. However, they can move while in the air.
The player's goal is to collect their transcript for their interview at the top. To do so they must jump on blocks, while avoiding
falling into the spikes. However, some blocks are fake and will kill the player as well. Therefore, the player must also memorize which
blocks are real, and which blocks are fake.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Memorization
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The fact that the player has to memorize which blocks are real and which are fake.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is that you, the player, start out on the bottom on a small platform. There are
many other platforms, some real and some fake, that lead up to a transcript. That transcript is vital
for an interview. You must collect it.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
None.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience are people that enjoy slightly frustrating platformers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
It depends on how long it takes for players to either memorize the positions of the fakes, or
just get incredibly lucky.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The main strategy is sheer memorization. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
My previous digital assignments.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Can't really decide which one does.
